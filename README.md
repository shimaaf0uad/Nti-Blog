# Nti-Blog
As part of an NTI training task, I developed a simple website using HTML and CSS. The website aims to showcase [project idea/business], and includes a top navigation bar, a hero section, and multiple sections such as About Us, Services, Gallery, and Contact. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
